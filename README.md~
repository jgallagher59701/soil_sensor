# Soil Sensor

This repository holds software for a simple sensor network that can functionin 
remote and harsh envroments while still providing a near real-time data feed.
The sensors measure basic parameters of soil: tempterature and moisture.

The software (and hardware designs) here are for the sensor (leaf) nodes in a
start topology network. These sensor nods use LoRa to communicate with
a master node.

## Building

This software can be built using platformio.

Lora, Satellite modem, Arduino, pro8MHzatmega328
